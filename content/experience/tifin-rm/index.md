- **Led production deployment** of semantic caching system, successfully migrating to MPNet embeddings
- **Achieved sustained latency improvement** of over 2.5 seconds—a more than 40% reduction that dramatically enhanced user experience for financial advisors
- **Expanded system coverage** by developing automated query variation generators and implementing sophisticated deduplication methods

### Alternative Investments Expansion
- **Spearheaded expansion** of TIFIN RM's capabilities to support alternative investments—hedge funds, private equity, and other non-traditional assets
- **Developed sophisticated intent recognition** to distinguish between traditional and alternative investment queries
- **Expanded entity recognition systems** to handle new product categories while ensuring consistent performance across the expanded domain

### Production Excellence
- **Resolved critical production issues** affecting customer demonstrations
- **Optimized response generators** through aggressive prompt engineering
- **Systematically improved data quality** through anonymization and misclassification correction
- **Managed the inherent tension** in production ML systems: maintaining stability for existing users while continuously improving capabilities

## Technical Skills Developed

- **Production ML Systems:** End-to-end deployment and maintenance of machine learning systems at enterprise scale
- **Financial Domain Expertise:** Deep understanding of traditional and alternative investment products
- **System Optimization:** Balancing performance, reliability, and feature expansion in production environments
- **Collaborative Engineering:** Working with cross-functional teams to deliver customer-facing features

## Impact

This experience has demonstrated that my research capabilities translate effectively to production environments and has reinforced my desire to pursue graduate studies where I can develop deeper theoretical foundations while continuing to focus on AI systems with real-world impact.

The role has taught me that impactful AI engineering requires not just technical sophistication but also collaboration, systematic debugging skills, and a deep understanding of user needs in high-stakes financial environments.
