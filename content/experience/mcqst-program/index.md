## Research Project: Quantum Ground State Estimation

### Project Title
**"Quantum Ground State Estimation of SU(2) Gauge Theory using Variational Quantum Eigensolver"**

### Research Institution
**Walther-Meißner-Institut (WMI)**, part of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Bavarian Academy of Sciences)

### Research Team
- **Collaborators:** K. Liegener, M. Knudsen, M. Singh, M. Werninghaus, F. Roy
- **Principal Investigator:** Prof. S. Filipp
- **Research Focus:** Quantum simulation of fundamental physics

## Technical Research Contributions

### Problem Statement
Tackled one of the fundamental challenges in quantum physics: finding the ground state of interacting Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT). This is particularly challenging due to entanglement over spaced lattice sites that causes numerical simulations to break down at certain scales on classical computers.

### Methodology: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
- **Hybrid Algorithm:** Used VQE—a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm—to find ground state energy
- **Target System:** Simplified SU(2) Yang-Mills theory describing the weak force in particle physics
- **Quantum Hardware:** Implemented simulation on superconducting quantum device at WMI

### Technical Implementation

#### Hamiltonian Decomposition
- **Translated complex physical Hamiltonian** into quantum computer-usable form
- **Decomposed into electric and magnetic components** expressed as sums of Pauli string operators
- **Prepared simulation framework** for deployment on institute's 17-qubit chip

#### Quantum Architecture Design
- **4-qubit architecture:** 3 physical qubits encoding quantum states + 1 ancilla qubit
- **Ancilla qubit function:** Control circuit dynamics and enforce symmetry constraints
- **State preparation:** Quantum algorithms for initial state preparation

#### Physical System Mapping
- **Hilbert space truncation** to maximum angular momentum of j_max = 1/2
- **Ground state sector isolation**—the θ-graph—where physical states are uniquely defined
- **Quantum number encoding:** Three angular momentum quantum numbers (j₁, j₂, j₃)

### Advanced Quantum Techniques

#### Shots-Based Analysis
- **Realistic measurement simulation** using statistical sampling rather than exact energy computations
- **Post-selection techniques** to enforce symmetry by projecting measurement outcomes into valid, gauge-invariant physical Hilbert space
- **Noise analysis:** Demonstrated how energy landscape smooths as measurement shots increase

#### Variational Circuit Design
- **Problem-specific ansatz** with 6 tunable parameters
- **Gate sequence optimization:** Excitation and swap gates designed for efficient physical state space exploration
- **Parameter optimization:** Systematic approach to variational parameter tuning

## Research Insights and Contributions

### Theoretical Contributions
- **Truncation strategy validation:** Demonstrated how low energy cutoffs enable accurate modeling without simulating full infinite-dimensional Hilbert space
- **Symmetry utilization:** Showed how ground state symmetries help resolve VQA quantum advantage challenges
