## Overview

**Position:** DAAD WISE Scholar  
**Institution:** Berlin University of the Arts & Einstein Center for Digital Future  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Daniel D. Hromada, Juniorprofessor for Digital Education  
**Duration:** May 2024 - July 2024  
**Location:** Berlin, Germany

During my three-month DAAD WISE scholarship internship, I was selected as one of 250 recipients worldwide to work on the groundbreaking Reading Primer project and fibel.digital initiative. This experience combined cutting-edge AI research with practical hardware engineering for educational impact.

## Project: Personal Primer - Digital Reading Acquisition Assistant

### Project Overview
The Personal Primer is a digital education artifact designed to guide students aged 5-10 in developing fundamental literacy and numeracy skills. It functions as a user-friendly learning device—specifically, a Digital Reading Acquisition Assistant (DRAA)—that embraces the innovative concept of 'human-machine peer learning.'

### My Role and Contributions

#### Speech Recognition Development
- **Developed and programmed sophisticated speech recognition models**, particularly DeepSpeech and Whisper, for Human-Machine Peer Learning (HMPL) modules
- **Deployed audio-textual contents** from Book 1 of the Indian Fable collection, Panchatantra, on Raspberry Pi-driven Personal Primer Prototypes
- **Created a "personalized narration module"**—a complex system integrating language models, speech recognition, and adaptive learning systems

#### Technical Challenges Solved
- **Constructed Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system** capable of handling imperfect speech input—critical for young learners
- **Personalized the Primer system** to adapt to individual pupils' learning patterns and reading progress
- **Optimized system performance** for Raspberry Pi constraints while maintaining educational effectiveness

### Hardware and Software Engineering

#### Prototype Development
- **Engineered the prototype 'Fibel 4'**, significantly enhancing both hardware and software capabilities
- **Improved soldering techniques** and acquired proficiency in laser-cutting and 3D printing (both filament and resin methods)
- **Mastered Raspberry Pi and Raspbian Linux** development environment

#### Technical Skills Acquired
- **I2C sensors integration** for interactive hardware components
- **Bash scripting and vim proficiency** for system administration
- **Vector databases (Chroma)** for efficient content retrieval
- **Exercise-specific language models** with audio-context support for speech recognition

### Sustainability and Impact

#### Sustainable Design
- **Solar energy integration**—the device utilizes renewable energy, making it cost-effective and suitable for widespread adoption
- **Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** for accessible education technology
- **Optimized for resource-constrained environments** while discouraging prolonged usage

#### Research Integration
- **Gained proficiency in udk.ai's personalized NLP models** integral to the project's success
- **Demonstrated practical application** of advanced AI in educational technology
- **Built complete functional prototype** in just three months, showcasing rapid learning and adaptation

## Skills Developed

### Technical Competencies
